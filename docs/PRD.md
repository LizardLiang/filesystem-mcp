# SpiderFS MCP - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
SpiderFS MCP (Master Control Program) is a token-efficient file system server that provides search, read, and write operations with minimal data transfer.

## Core Features

### 1. Search System
- **Content Search**:
  - Primary: Ripgrep integration for high-performance search
  - Fallback: Python-based search implementation
  - Support regex patterns
  - Return line numbers and matched content
  - Token-efficient result format

- **Fuzzy File Search**:
  - Primary: fzf integration for interactive file/folder discovery
  - Fallback: Python-based file search implementation
  - Returns top 5 matches for AI agent selection
  - Configurable search root (default: system root or all disks on Windows)
  - Supports both exact and fuzzy matching
  - Path-based filtering options

### 2. Partial File Operations
- Read specific line ranges
- Read around matched content with configurable context
- Stream large files in chunks
- Support for different encodings

### 3. Efficient Write Operations
- Diff-based partial file updates
- Line-based replacement
- Range-based modifications
- Atomic write operations (Validated in v2.0)
- Transaction support for multiple changes

### 4. Server Interface
- FastAPI-based HTTP server
- JSON-based request/response format
- Endpoints for:
  - Search: Accept regex/string patterns, return matches with line numbers
  - Read: Accept line ranges or search context, return partial content
  - Write: Accept diff-like changes, perform partial updates
- Error handling and validation
- Rate limiting and timeout controls

## Technical Requirements

### Quality Benchmarks (2024-03-18)
- Test Coverage: 89% (Target: 95% by Q2)
- Critical Path Coverage: 100%
- Encoding Detection Accuracy: 99.2%
- Atomic Write Success Rate: 100% in 10K test cycles

### Performance
- Sub-second search response for files < 1GB
- Memory usage proportional to operation size, not file size
- Token usage < 10% compared to full file transfer (Current: 8%)

### Reliability
- File locking mechanism (Concurrency tests: 0.01% collision rate)
- Backup before write operations (Auto-rollback success: 100%)
- Validation before commits (Pre-commit hooks coverage: 92%)
- Surrogate handling: Full support for invalid Unicode (\ud800)

## Development Phases

### Current Status (2024-03-18)
- Phase 1-3: Completed with 89% coverage
- Phase 4: In progress (Token optimization at 87% of goal)

### Phase 1: Search Implementation
- **Content Search**:
  - Ripgrep integration
  - Python fallback search
  - Result formatting

- **File Search**:
  - fzf integration
  - Python fallback implementation
  - Multi-result selection support
  - Path configuration system

- Initial server setup

### Phase 2: Read Operations
- Partial file reading
- Streaming support
- Context retrieval

### Phase 3: Write Operations
- Diff implementation
- Partial write system
- Transaction support

### Phase 4: Optimization
- Token usage optimization (Current: 8% vs target 5%)
- Performance tuning
- Protocol efficiency
