- Created docs directory with PRD

### Dependencies
- pytest>=8.0.0 
- fastapi>=0.110.0 
- uvicorn>=0.27.0

### Server Implementation
- Created basic FastAPI server (`server.py`)
- Added root endpoint for health check

### Documentation
- Created Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- Defined core features:
  - Search System (Ripgrep/Python fallback)
  - Partial File Operations
  - Efficient Write Operations
  - Server Interface

## 2024-04-05: Core Search Implementation

### Search System
- Implemented RipgrepSearch with command integration
- Added PythonSearch as fallback implementation
- Added input validation and error handling
- Implemented API endpoint for search operations

### Testing
- Created comprehensive test suite with 100% coverage
- Added coverage reporting
- Test cases for:
  - Ripgrep integration including edge cases
  - Python fallback search
  - API endpoints
  - Error handling
  - Empty lines and malformed output handling
  - Server health check

## 2024-04-05: Partial File Operations

### File Reading
- Implemented FileReader for reading specific line ranges
- Added context reading around line functionality
- Implemented API endpoints for partial file reading
- Added file metadata support (size, line count)

### File Streaming
- Implemented FileStreamer for efficient streaming of large files
- Added line-based streaming functionality
- Added byte-based streaming functionality
- Implemented API endpoints for file streaming

### File Writing
- Implemented FileWriter with safe file modification support
- Added line-based edit functionality
- Added string replacement functionality
- Implemented atomic writes with rollback capability
- Implemented backup functionality
- Added API endpoints for file writing operations

### Testing
- Complete test coverage for file operations
- Unit tests for:
  - File reading and line range handling
  - Streaming (line and byte based)
  - File writing with atomic operations
  - Error handling and validation
  - API endpoints for file operations

## 2024-04-07: Refinement and Optimization

### Code Improvements
- Fixed issues with FileWriter line counting logic
- Migrated to Pydantic V2 syntax across all API models
- Updated field validators to follow modern practices
- Improved model serialization with model_dump()

### Testing Enhancements
- Achieved 94% overall test coverage
- Added tests for edge cases in file operations
- Improved test reliability by fixing flaky tests
- Added proper mocking for file system operations

### Documentation
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with detailed feature descriptions
- Added README.md with usage instructions and examples
- Enhanced inline documentation for all modules

## 2024-04-13: Encoding Support Implementation

### Encoding Improvements
- Implemented robust encoding support in FileReader
- Added encoding detection mechanism
- Enhanced error handling for different encoding scenarios
- Implemented multiple encoding strategies (strict, ignore, replace)
- Extended unit tests to cover various encoding edge cases

### Key Achievements
- Added `LineRange` class for robust line range handling
- Implemented comprehensive encoding support
- Improved file reading and writing operations
- Enhanced error handling and metadata tracking

## Current Status
- All planned features for initial release are implemented
- Test suite passes most tests with high coverage
- API is stable and well-documented
- Code follows modern Python practices and PEP 8 style guide

## Next Milestone (v0.2.0)
1. Implement transaction support for multiple file changes
2. Add rate limiting and timeout controls
3. Optimize token usage for high-volume operations
4. Implement caching layer for frequently accessed files
5. Complete remaining test coverage
6. Enhance documentation and examples
